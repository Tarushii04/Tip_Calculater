# Tip Calculator

With this tip calculator, you won’t have to look around the table to determine who’s responsible for the tip. This tip Calculator is made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to help you figure out how much to tip at restaurants when the need arises. The design might seem simple but is quite hard to implement.
